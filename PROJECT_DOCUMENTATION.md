# Stock Market Prediction App - User Guide

## What is This App?
This is a smart tool that helps you predict stock prices using advanced computer technology. Think of it as a digital financial advisor that uses different methods to analyze stock market data and make predictions about future stock prices.

1. **Smart Pattern Finder (SVR)**: Looks for patterns in stock prices using different techniques
2. **Trend Analyzer (Linear Regression)**: Predicts future prices based on past trends
3. **Tree-based Predictor**: Makes decisions like a flowchart to predict prices
4. **Nearest Neighbor**: Compares current stock behavior with similar past situations
5. **Deep Learning (LSTM)**: Uses advanced technology to learn from historical patterns
